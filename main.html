    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains reasonable even for larger input sizes. Engineers strive to design algorithms with optimal time complexity to ensure fast execution and responsiveness.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, deals with the memory usage of an algorithm. It measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem as a function of the input size. Space complexity is particularly important when working with limited memory resources. An algorithm's space complexity is often denoted by Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in scenarios where memory resources are constrained, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.
